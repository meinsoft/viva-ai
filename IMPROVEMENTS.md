# Viva-AI Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the viva-ai system to create a truly intelligent, interactive, and conversational AI assistant for blind and visually impaired users.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. ✅ Summarization Not Working
**Problem:** When users said "summarize", the system didn't reliably trigger the summarization feature.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced intent recognition in `packages/prompts/intent_prompt.js` to explicitly recognize "summarize" as a high-confidence intent (0.95+)
- Added multiple examples and rules to ensure "summarize" by itself is understood as a clear command
- The system now reliably recognizes variations: "summarize", "summarize this page", "sum it up", "read this"

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/prompts/intent_prompt.js` - Enhanced intent recognition rules
- Added explicit confidence scoring for summarization intent

---

### 2. ✅ Speech Recognition Too Simplistic - No Clarification
**Problem:** The system immediately jumped to Google search for vague queries like "find an article" without asking what the user wanted.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the `/ai/clarify` endpoint in `apps/backend/routes/ai.js` with smarter logic
- Added CRITICAL RULES that prevent immediate searches for vague queries:
  - "search" without topic → asks "What would you like me to search for?"
  - "find an article" → asks "What topic would you like me to search for?"
  - "search for it" → asks for clarification on what "it" refers to
- The AI now thinks deeply before acting and asks clarifying questions proactively

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/backend/routes/ai.js` - Enhanced clarification prompt with critical search rules
- `packages/prompts/intent_prompt.js` - Added guidance to trust clarification endpoint

**New Behavior:**
```
User: "find an article"
AI: "What topic would you like me to search for?"
User: "machine learning"
AI: "Sure, searching for machine learning articles"
```

---

### 3. ✅ No Persistent Memory for Articles and Experiments
**Problem:** The system had no long-term memory. Articles, experiments, and Q&A sessions were lost after the browser session ended.

**Solution:**
- Created a complete **Persistent Memory System** (`packages/storage/persistent_memory.js`)
- Uses `chrome.storage.local` for persistent storage across sessions
- Stores:
  - **Articles**: Full content, summaries, metadata, tags
  - **Experiments**: Extracted procedures and experiments from articles
  - **Q&A History**: All questions and answers linked to articles
  - **Search Index**: Fast keyword-based article search

**Features:**
- Articles are automatically saved when summarized
- Q&A sessions are automatically linked to articles
- Can search through stored knowledge even "100 years later"
- Experiments are automatically extracted and stored
- Full-text search capability

**Files Created:**
- `packages/storage/persistent_memory.js` - Main storage implementation
- `packages/storage/package.json` - Package configuration

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/backend/routes/ai.js` - Integrated memory into summarize and Q&A endpoints
- `apps/backend/package.json` - Added storage dependency

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /ai/knowledge/search` - Search stored articles and experiments
- `POST /ai/knowledge/extract-experiments` - Extract experiments from articles
- `GET /ai/knowledge/stats` - Get knowledge base statistics

---

### 4. ✅ Improved Intent Recognition and Context Understanding
**Problem:** Intent recognition didn't understand context well and couldn't handle nuanced queries.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the intent prompt with 15 autonomous reasoning rules
- Added explicit handling for edge cases:
  - "summarize" alone = clear intent (confidence 0.96)
  - "search" without topic = needs clarification
  - Context-aware "continue" command based on last action
- Integrated memory context into intent classification

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/prompts/intent_prompt.js` - Enhanced reasoning rules and examples
- `apps/backend/routes/ai.js` - Pass memory context to clarification

---

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Tab Navigation Algorithm
**Problem:** Tab switching had basic fuzzy matching that didn't work well for common cases.

**Solution:**
- Improved `executeTabSwitch` in `apps/extension/src/background.js` with:
  - **Domain-level matching**: "github" matches any `github.com` tab
  - **Recency boost**: Recently accessed tabs score slightly higher
  - **Triple scoring**: Scores title, URL, and domain separately
  - **Lower threshold**: Reduced from 30 to 25 for better accessibility

**New Features:**
- `extractDomain()` helper function for domain matching
- Intelligent scoring that considers multiple factors
- Better handling of common site names

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/extension/src/background.js` - Enhanced tab switching logic

---

### 6. ✅ Article Knowledge Base with Q&A
**Problem:** No way to ask questions about previously read articles or remember experiments.

**Solution:**
- Integrated persistent memory into summarization and Q&A workflows
- Articles are automatically saved with full content and summaries
- Q&A sessions are linked to their source articles
- Can search through all stored articles and experiments
- Experiments are automatically extracted using AI

**Workflow:**
1. User: "summarize this page"
2. System: Generates summary + saves article to persistent memory
3. User: "What experiments were mentioned?"
4. System: Extracts experiments + saves them + answers question
5. Later (even months later):
   - User: "search my articles for machine learning experiments"
   - System: Returns all relevant articles and experiments

### Before:
```
User: "summarize"
System: *may or may not work, inconsistent*
```

### After:
```
User: "summarize"
System: "Okay, let me summarize this article for you"
System: *generates summary, saves to memory*
System: "This article discusses [summary]..."
```

---

### Before:
```
*Articles and Q&A lost after session ends*
*No way to remember experiments*
```

### After:
```
User: "summarize this ML tutorial"
System: *saves article + summary*

[3 months later]

User: "search my articles for machine learning experiments"
System: "I found 3 articles with ML experiments:
  1. Machine Learning Tutorial - 5 experiments
  2. Neural Networks Guide - 3 experiments
  3. Deep Learning Basics - 7 experiments"
```

## Technical Details

### Persistent Memory Data Structure
```javascript
{
  articles: {
    [articleId]: {
      id, url, title, content, summary,
      metadata: { summarizedAt, ... },
      experiments: [experimentIds...],
      qaHistory: [{question, answer, timestamp}...],
      tags: [...],
      visitedAt, summarizedAt
    }
  },
  experiments: {
    [experimentId]: {
      id, title, description, articleId, articleUrl, extractedAt
    }
  },
  qaIndex: {
    [questionHash]: {
      question, answer, articleId, timestamp
    }

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Summarization Flow
```
1. Open an article
2. Say "summarize"
3. Verify: Summary is generated and spoken
4. Check: Article is saved to persistent memory
5. Ask: "What was the main point?"
6. Verify: Q&A is saved to memory
```

#### 2. Clarification Flow
```
1. Say "find an article"
2. Verify: System asks "What topic would you like me to search for?"
3. Say "machine learning"
4. Verify: System searches for machine learning articles
```

#### 3. Knowledge Persistence
```
1. Summarize multiple articles
2. Close and reopen browser
3. Say "search my articles for [topic]"
4. Verify: Previously saved articles are found
```

#### 4. Tab Navigation
```
1. Open multiple tabs (github.com, youtube.com, etc.)
2. Say "switch to github"
3. Verify: Switches to correct github tab
4. Say "go to youtube"
5. Verify: Switches to youtube tab
```

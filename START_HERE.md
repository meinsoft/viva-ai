# üöÄ Viva.AI - Quick Start

## ONE-MINUTE SETUP

### Step 1: Create API Key File

Create a file called `.env` in this folder with your Gemini API key:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 2: Start Backend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**WAIT** until you see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 3: Load Extension

1. Open Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `apps/extension` folder from this project
5. Click the Viva.AI icon in Chrome toolbar

### Step 4: Enable Debug Mode (See What's Happening!)

1. Click the Viva.AI extension icon
2. Press F12 (opens console)
3. In the console, type:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('viva_debug', '1')
```
4. Reload the extension

Now you'll see detailed logs of everything happening!

## ‚úÖ TEST IT WORKS

1. Go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
2. Click Viva.AI icon
3. Click "üé§ Start Listening"
4. Say: **"summarize this page"**

**You should see:**
- Status updates: "üß† Understanding..." ‚Üí "üìù Planning..." ‚Üí "‚öôÔ∏è Executing..."
- The AI speaks the summary aloud
- Status shows: "‚úÖ I'll summarize this page for you"

**If it doesn't work:**
- Check the backend terminal - is it still running?
- Check the browser console (F12) - any errors?
- See TESTING.md for full debugging guide

## üéØ Try These Commands

| Say This | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| "summarize this page" | Reads and summarizes the article |
| "search for Python tutorials" | Searches Google and announces results |
| "switch to YouTube" | Switches to YouTube tab (if open) |
| "go to Gmail" | Opens Gmail tab |
| "what is Python used for?" | Answers based on current page |

## üêõ Something Not Working?

**Most common issue:** Backend not running!

**Quick check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

If you get an error, the backend isn't running. Start it with:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Full debugging guide:** See TESTING.md

## üìä See What's in Memory

In the extension popup console (F12):
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get('viva_persistent_memory', (data) => {
  console.log('Articles saved:', data.viva_persistent_memory?.articles?.length || 0);
  console.log('Conversations saved:', data.viva_persistent_memory?.conversations?.length || 0);
});
```

## üîß Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Failed to fetch" | Backend not running ‚Üí `npm run dev` |
| No speech recognition | Allow microphone in Chrome |
| Nothing happens | Enable debug mode and check console |
| Silent (no voice) | Check volume, check for TTS errors in console |

## üé§ For Blind Users

This extension is designed for you! Here's what you need to know:

1. **Everything is spoken aloud** - summaries, answers, search results
2. **No need to look at screen** - just listen for the status updates
3. **Memory is permanent** - every article and Q&A is saved forever
4. **Natural conversation** - speak naturally, AI understands context

### Voice Commands That Work:
- "Read this to me" / "Summarize this page"
- "What does this say?" / "What's this about?"
- "Search for [topic]"
- "Switch to [app name]" / "Go to [site]"
- "Tell me more about [topic from page]"

The AI remembers everything, so you can ask:
- "What was that article about carrots I read yesterday?"
- "Did I already summarize this?"

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced: Check Backend Endpoints

```bash
# Test intent classification
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"utterance":"summarize","pageMap":{},"memory":{},"locale":"en"}'

# Test summarization
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Test article","url":"http://test","title":"Test"}'

# All should return JSON (not errors)
```
